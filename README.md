# GameCollectionTrackers
A few small applications to keep track of video game collections (for niche systems) - the target audience of these applications is me but perhaps someone else will find them useful.

-TurboGrafx-16 Collector - Android 2.1 application to track TurboGrafx-16 and TurboGrafx-16 CD games.

-Sega CD Collector - Android 2.1 application to track Sega CD games.

-Sega 32X Collector (Android) - Android 1.3 application to track Sega 32X games.

-Sega 32X Collector (J2ME) - Java Mobile application to track Sega 32X games. 

**Project Status**

This project is now archived. These are all for obsolete mobile platforms and I am not interested in keeping them current. I found that a spreadsheet worked just as well.
